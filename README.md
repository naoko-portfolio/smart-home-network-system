# Smart Home Network Automation System

BTN 415 - Data Communications Programming Project

## Overview
A multithreaded client-server smart home automation system built in C++.
Users control simulated devices (lights, thermostat, security cameras) over
a TCP network using an HTTP-like application protocol. The system implements
subnetting, VLSM, static routing, ARP resolution, and ICMP.

## Network Design
- Base network: 192.168.1.0/24
- Subnet 1 (Lighting):    192.168.1.0/26   — up to 62 hosts
- Subnet 2 (Thermostat):  192.168.1.64/27  — up to 30 hosts
- Subnet 3 (Security):    192.168.1.96/27  — up to 30 hosts
- Subnet 4 (Management):  192.168.1.128/28 — up to 14 hosts
